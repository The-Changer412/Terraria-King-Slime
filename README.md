# Terraria King Slime <img src="images/readme_images/other/icon.png" alt="Icon" width="50"/>

This is a Don't Starve Together mod that adds in King Slime from Terraria.
LEGAL NOTICE: For obvious and legal reasons, I do not own the assets in this mod, and they belong to their respective owner (Re-Logic and Klei Entertainment).

Note that for modders looking through the source code, some of the stuff that I did in here isn't the official way of doing due to me not able to get it to work, so I did them in a janky way.
